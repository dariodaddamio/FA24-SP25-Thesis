# FA24-SP25-Thesis
Includes progress toward completing Barrett Honors thesis during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters. Learning JavaScript -> TypeScript with necessary HTML and CSS supplements that arise along the way, then incorporating into MongoDB and implementing in Discord. The project focuses on developing a Discord bot that integrates an ELO/ranking system for the ASU billiards club. The bot will serve as a digital facilitator for match organization, result tracking, and player ranking, enhancing the club's operational efficiency and engagement. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly, reliable, and interactive system that not only supports the club's activities but also provides valuable data-driven insights into player performance and engagement trends.
